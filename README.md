# movie_renamer

A small project to help me rename movies that have been downloaded from mediasack.com

## What it does

It converts video files from a fromat like Title-Year* to format Title (Year)/Title (Year).*

It places the new directory with the video file inside the folder that the original file was located

It uses (www.omdbapi.com)[https://www.omdbapi.com] to check the name and year of the movie are correct there you need to add your own api key which can be done in Settings
